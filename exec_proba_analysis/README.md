# Preliminary Analysis on Execution Probability in Limit Order Books
## Overview
This project aims to provide a preliminary analysis on the execution probability of trades within a specific time frame or a given number of events in a Limit Order Book (LOB). The study considers multiple variables, including time, distance in the LOB, and imbalance at varying depths. Our primary output is generally represented using spline interpolation for more nuanced insights.

## Keywords
- Execution Probability
- Limit Order Book (LOB)
- Time Delay
- Imbalance
- Spline Interpolation
- Trade Execution
- Market Depth
## Objectives
- Time-Based Analysis: Evaluate the impact of time delay, expressed either in seconds or in the number of LOB events, on trade execution probability.

- Distance in LOB: Study how the distance from the current market price in the LOB affects the likelihood of order execution.

- Imbalance Calculation: Explore the relationship between imbalance (calculated at different depths) and execution probability.

- Spline Interpolation: Utilize spline methods to generate more nuanced visual representations of the findings.
